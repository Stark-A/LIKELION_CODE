Michael D. Cole,5.0," April 10, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"My job gave me a computer with a crap ass keyboard that had broken feet and the previous guy's nastiness all over the keys.  I could have waited for them to slowly decide when it was in the budget to replace a crap ass stock keyboard with another crap ass stock keyboard, but I decided I had waited long enough.  If I am going to spend the better part of 8 hours staring at a computer, I might as well make it my own.  So I dropped a couple of bucks and got a keyboard and mouse that would be complete overkill for an office environment... and it's perfect.  Why?  Because now my boring ol' office has some uniqueness to it, making me forget I am trapped at a desk.  Now I am trapped at a desk with peripherals that are much better than anyone else.  This may not be a big deal to you, but in my mind, it's better to do the mundane tasks on a keyboard that visually distracts me with colorful bliss.  The mouse takes the feeling of dread I had from clicking that worn out stock mouse and gives me the excitement I need to not only click, but DOUBLE CLICK as well.  I'm sure i could play games and other things with it too.So why did I buy a gaming mouse and keyboard for an office computer?  Because I'm awesome.  That, and think about it... gamers sit there for hours double-clicking to use the Sword of Gondor repeatedly, so it must be comfortable.  Logic.","1,152"
Kels,5.0," April 23, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"I was looking for a keyboard/mouse set to play some games on my PS4 (trying to get used to it before getting a PC) and this set is exactly what I wanted. It works flawlessly, all I had to do was plug it in. No adaptor, no extra USB hub... nothing. It works GREAT right out of the box!It’s also really cool looking; the mouse has a fabric wire which is really nice to have, and both cords are very long. I really love this set and I’m really happy with my purchase! Awesome stuff.",476
Jon Almada,5.0," August 4, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I've since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I've made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I've built to date.  Software is indeed on their website but it is a little strange to find - The mouse is on the website as ""Redragon M601-3 CENTROPHORUS 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse "" and has two downloadable executables - The Windows 10 version works just fine. I rarely run the software since it works fine without it but it is nice to be able to change the mouse parameters if needed.",357
Shawn,5.0," July 11, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"I bought this for my kid so I wasn't too concerned about what I thought about it for a low cost keyboard and mouse combo. They just wanted the lights. But after using it myself on their system, I have to say the mouse and keyboard actually feel and work really really good!  And the LEDs actually look really good on both of them too! They beat up both a lot and still work after 4 plus months with no issues.While I am still planning to replace my workhorse basic keyboard with a programmable RGB like the Corsair K70 RGB or something by G.Skill or Logitech; if you are looking for a great budget combo with lights. This ones feels great to type on and looks great too for the price. I really am shocked. If you are building a new system and want to space out spending money on the really nice gaming keyboards, or refreshing the experience on and old system with worn keyboard, this is a great option. I didn't test for ghosting, but I didn't have any issues with any games or software.",162
Brian S.,5.0," August 25, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"My son wasn't enjoying my old 2005 logitech wireless and keyboard with his gaming so we grabbed this deal. So far we are all happy, the mouse is accurate and has a nice feel. The keyboard looks great with the backlit colors, which can pulse, scroll, and be dimmed and brightened. The keys have a bit softer of a feel than I am used to but it hasn't hindered me in any way. For this price we couldn't be happier, we very much recommend this.",152
Iván,1.0," December 1, 2017",Reviewed in the United States ,"I just got this product, after it was delayed for a day.The mouse works great but the keyboard came defective, I will have to return it, because several keys (W, H, ., backspace, delete) don't work.I tried changing the usb port but it did not work.",166
marimikk,5.0," December 13, 2017",Reviewed in the United States ,"I've only been using the keyboard at work for about week, and so far it's been great. I like that I can select a 'solid' color (vs multiple colors) and each day I change the color (Fn+Home) - I've received lots of comments on the cool colors. The keys are a perfect distance from each other & are easy to press. My old MS keyboard at home forces me to use more pressure on the keys & therefore I find I make more typos. I don't have that problem with this keyboard. The only thing I miss having is a button for the calculator.I like the mouse too. The only complaint is that sometimes my forefinger doesn't automatically find the scroll wheel (it's between two ridges that are slightly too high) & I have to look at the mouse to find it.",114
John W. Allen,5.0," November 29, 2017",Reviewed in the United States ,"I've only been using it since yesterday, but I am already won over by this keyboard and mouse combo. Now, the M601-3 Centrophorus mouse is great. It's heavy, glides smoothly, the buttons are responsive, and the size is just right for my hands. That alone is worth the money, but I'm not focusing on the mouse in this review, but the keyboard.This keyboard is a delight. Typing on it is comfortable, the keys are sturdy, give a nice tactile response, and aren't so loud as to wake sleeping members of the household as I type. There was a time when I could type 130 WPM with zero errors, but for years that number was severely reduced due to a number of issues: carpal tunnel, arthritis, and poorly made keyboards. Right now I'm typing around 110 WPM with zero errors, and the keyboard isn't even breaking a sweat. This is probably the best it will ever get for me, but I am already amazed. I never thought I'd be able to type this fast ever again, but the keyboard is laid out in such a way, with the keys themselves offering a terrific response that lets my fingers bounce from one key to another without any interference or lag, that I don't even feel like I'm straining at keeping up the pace.I realize this isn't a mechanical keyboard, but it does feel like one. I mean, if you can't afford a mechanical keyboard, the Redragon Harpe K503RGB is a fantastic deal, and I haven't even got to the fun part yet: the lights!As you know from the description, the keyboard lights up in a rainbow pattern, as well as 7 colors, including my two favorites: purple, and white. It also has a spectrum option which shows a steady rainbow that doesn't blink, or you can have one that ""breathes."" It's all rather lovely, and it's a dream for me to type at night. I touch type, but sometimes you need to see the keys, even in the dark, and I have no trouble seeing where my hands are placed, or where I'm going while I'm typing at night.All in all, I got this combo for a steal. $30? It's easily worth twice that much, IMO. As a budget gamer, I never thought I'd be able to afford a keyboard and mouse with this kind of quality. I highly recommend this for anyone who doesn't have a lot of money, but would like to be productive as a gamer, as a typist, and as a general computer user.5 out of 5 Stars. Buy it.",83
Robert,1.0," January 30, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Not a lot to like on this combo.  Even at this price point (under $30), it's hard to justify buying this.1.  The main impression I got when I opened the package was how cheap it looked and felt.  So plasticky.  So unfinished.  (Even before opening the package, I was surprised by how the vendor shipped it.  No shipping box, no cushioning materials.  It was shipped in the original product box with a mailing label slapped onto it.  Talk about being cheap!)2.  The keyboard.- The keyboard feels mushy, not crisp.- Keys are NOT individually lit, instead groups of keys are lit.  That, in itself isn't so bad, but about half the light bleeds out from under the sides of the keys - making the backlighting a distraction.- The green and the yellow colors are barely adequate to work in daylight conditions, the other colors are just not bright enough.- The number keys are disingenuously labeled.  IMO, they are ""backward"".  For example , the ""1"" on the one key is displayed on the top, while the ""!"" is on the bottom.  Moreover, only the ""1"" is backlit, the ""!"" remains dark no matter what.  So, it is difficult (impossible in the dark) to read any of the symbols below the numbers.3.  The mouse.- The mouse feels especially cheap.  It must weigh an ounce, much too light to comfortably move around.- It has an gritty finish that seems to rub off when touched.  After a short period of time, my guess is that the rough finish will smooth out ... but meanwhile it's just plain uncomfortable to use.- And the mouse doesn't change color, it's just plain red.  Instead of enhancing the look of the mouse, the red led light seem to highlight the cheap plastic used in its manufacture.- The buttons work, but they, too, feel cheap.  Clickety cheap.I cannot recommend this product, even for entry level use.",23
Amber,1.0," July 14, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,Product worked great and would have been a 5 star but the space bar stopped working after 5 months. The keyboard is considered computer equipment so only a 30 day warranty applies.Took apart to see if there was an issue with a spring and their are cheap rubber buttons that act as springs. The one for the space bar was deteriorated down to nothing and many others looked about to fail.,25
Katie,5.0," January 22, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"No really, I know nothing about gaming.  If you're reading this review and you're a gamer... you probably want to read another one.  If you're the mother of a 10 year old kid who wants a gaming keyboard and you looked them up and were all ""Uh... yeah no. I'm not spending that on a gaming keyboard"" and you came to Amazon - this fits the bill.  My particular 10 year old isn't a hardcore gamer either, he just watches youtube video's and the people who have loud high pitched voices and British accents (why are they all British?) must use them (not this one, gaming keyboards/mice in general). Anyway, I got him this for Christmas and he loves the keyboard.  He says the mouse could use one more button but he likes it anyway.  He uses this with a PS4, I'm pretty sure it can be used with xbox and obviously it would work with a PC.",21
Sheila Nolan,1.0," April 27, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"So, what do I like about this set? Not a SINGLE thing. The mouse began to malfunction within about 10 days, and proved to be worthless for regular PC use, and even more useless of low level games ( like those on POGO) so for it to be promoted as a ""gaming set"" is absurd. (unless annoying flashing lights equals good performance in the eyes of gamers) It doesn't track and clicking is fairly hit and miss. About 1/3 of the times when you click it does nothing, and the side buttons are hair trigger and they shut screens and change where you are at the lightest brush. As of the AM it is in a thousand pieces, because the only pleasure I have gotten out of this POS waste of plastic was stomping it into  oblivion after it closed out and lost a document when I brushed on of those side buttons with my thumb while trying to make the cursor move. If I could go punch the person who developed this POS in the mouth, I'd fly to China to do it. The keyboard is a whole 'nother thing...It is designed for people with very tiny hands apparently, and anyone with a sizable reach, who was trained on a typical/standard keyboard, will make constant typing mistakes...and honestly, the whole color thing is just freaking annoying, and you have to manually set it to the least annoying setting every time you restart your computer. Who needs that? Maybe a teenager who doesn't have anything real to accomplish on a computer, but not a normal human who has actual work to do. Beyond that, some keys you really have to strike fairly hard to make the keystroke register, other times if you brush the top of a button as you are moving around the keyboard to type, it will register that keystroke, so spelling mistake are an every single minute occurrence unless one types in the same manner as I was taught in High School typing class ( every keystroke performed with hands hovering about an inch over the keyboard, and my hands in full secretarial position.) I bought this POS set January 24, and today is April 27th, and I bought it because it had such high ratings for usability, and the price was decent...I wasn't expecting it to last more than a year or so, because that seems to be about the length of time and any keyboard and mouse will last these days, even with just average use. This POS lasted 3 months ( okay, I might have gotten another week out of it had I not taken the extreme pleasure of smashing the mouse...and the Keyboard is next as soon as I can shop in person for a new one that hopefully won't be yet another piece of crap) If it were possible to leave a negative rating for this crap set, I absolutely would.",14
R.A.H.,3.0," December 26, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"I've been using this keyboard for a few weeks now.

William,1.0," May 3, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"I got the keyboard and mouse and they are pretty good. Here's the problem. No software, drivers or any instruction. Go to the website to get the software to control the lighting and speed and it does not install properly and caused my windows to crash. After an hour of removing and restarting it is ok. Looks good and I will keep them because they work but I cannot alter the colors or breathing speed or anything. Would be 5 stars with the software.PS. Support on the website is awful. No help at all",14
Amazon Customer,1.0," December 22, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"UPDATE: Changed to 1 star, wish I could select 0 stars. 1 star seems unfairly high. The mouse is unbearable. It regularly stops connecting to the computer for a fraction of a second which makes it impossible to use for gaming or most tasks. The mouse pointer itself will wiggle and move around on the screen in large arcs even without me touching the mouse or desk. Luckily I got a refund for it and I will be throwing these items in the trash. This was a huge waste of time and effort and I urge anyone reading this to choose a different brand.I am extremely disappointed in this purchase. The keys for the keyboard are very gummy feeling and don't seem very pleasant to type on. Not only that, but some of the keys are extremely unresponsive. I have to smash the shift key in order to get it to respond. I also bought it thinking that it came with keyboard software to reprogram keys and macros, which it does not. Also, I was very excited to have the colors on the keys and utilize the cool effects, but all of the effects are really loud. Like, when I put it on ""breathing"" mode I hear a reasonably loud electrical whine when it is cycling from on to off, to the point where I only use a solid color because it's so jarring to my ears.As for the mouse, it is okay. The thumb buttons are really far forward for how I hold the mouse but I think they would work for other people. The texture on the mouse is very pleasant and I like the ability to add/remove weights. As for the responsiveness though, I bought a wired gaming mouse thinking it was going to be more responsive but it is not. It is pretty unresponsive and seems to drift a lot. There have been a lot of times where I am not even touching the mouse and the on-screen cursor is wiggling back and forth and drifting around.All in all I would recommend getting something else.Will it work? Yea.Am I happy with the purchase? Absolutely not.The product also arrived over a week late, which isn't the manufacturer's fault but I feel it necessary to include in the review.",5
Aaron Atkins,4.0," June 11, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Tactile feedback is good on the keyboard, but it's taking a bit of time for me to get used to the layout of the keyboard compared to my old trusty Dell keyboard that this was replacing. That, I'll chock up to just me needing more time to get used to it. The weights in the mouse make it feel nice. However, there is no official software for the keyboard, which resets back to rainbow puke every time I boot my computer, which with my ADHD is distracting. The website doesn't officially support the mouse anymore, but the M601-3 mouse drivers and software are compatible, which also helps to remap the buttons. Ordinarily I'd like to turn off the lights for this keyboard, but with them off, the keys are really dull, so I leave them on a solid red during use. Also, was afraid that my keyboard was broken on arrival, but it just doesn't work in a USB 2.0 port and needs USB 3.In short:Pros:Looks niceKeyboard is programmable for RGBGreat for typing at nightKeyboard and mouse have nice tactile feedbackMouse buttons can be programmedShortcut buttons are nice.Cons:Layout may be slightly off compared to what you are used toKeyboard loses your RGB settings if your PC is turned offSoftware was a slight pain to find (You need Red Dragon USA, not the worldwide site, but if you are on the worldwide site, you can use the M601-3 driver download)Needs USB 3.0+ for the keyboard, USB 2.0 ports would not provide enough power for it to functionNo software to reprogram the shortcut keys or maintain the RGB settings on the keyboard.",6
Cheryl,4.0," October 7, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"I bought the keyboard + mouse set as an upgrade from my previous keyboard. I had an old emachines keyboard that I dearly loved, but the print has worn off many keys and some of the keys take considerable pressure to function, so it was time to upgrade. I will be using this for coding and extensive word processing, not gaming, so that's what this review is based on.Mouse: The mouse is nice. It's got a nice weight. The texture on the buttons gives it a good feel. It glides on the mousepad well with no skips. It's plug-and-play, although you need the driver in order to program the extra buttons. (see below) I haven't used the DPI switch, since I wont' need this for my work. The funny little contour points at the back end of the mouse are quite handy for moving the mouse around when selecting large amounts of text. No noticeable delay between click and computer response.Keyboard: The keyboard is ok. I'm kind of a ""banger"" when it comes to typing (I press hard on the keys as I type.) But this keyboard makes considerably less noise than my last keyboard... much softer sound and keypress (if that makes any sense). I was hoping to have the static rainbow illumination for the backlight, but haven't figured out how to do that yet. (see below) My biggest complaint is that it's missing the little notches on the ""J"" key that I used to use to orient my fingers when I begin typing. It has a notch on the ""F"" and the ""5"" on the tenkeys area, but not on the ""J"".Instructions: This is where this set really fails. A very thick booklet is included with this set, but don't get excited. Most of the book is translations. There's only about 3-5 pages of instructions, in very small print (I needed to get a magnifier to read them!), and the instructions aren't complete. The instructions could be written with more clarity about how to change colors, and the website for downloading drivers isn't even listed. AND when you do Google-search and find the website, you'll find that the model number on the booklet (and mouse & keyboard) isn't the same as the one on the website. (If you read the Q&A for this item, you'll see what I mean.)Overall, the instructions are the worst problem with this item. If you can get beyond this, it's not a bad set for the price. Definitely makes you feel like you spent more than you did for the set. :)",8
Robert Eyerly,5.0," January 19, 2016",Reviewed in the United States ,"Let me start by saying, I love this product. I can say with complete honesty, that I do not think you can find a better Mouse/Keyboard combo out there for the price ($27.99 with free 2-day shipping w/ my Prime subscription). Having said that, please understand that you are getting a mouse/keyboard combo on the cheap, and although in this case I don't necessarily agree with the ""you get what you pay for"" sentiment because this has far exceeded my expectations for the price, it is still a $30 combo so keep that in mind when purchasing as not to be disappointed if you are expecting this thing to walk your dog. It does not come with software, does not have macros, etc. (although it does have function keys for your basics like changing volume, media player play/pause, next track, etc.) In other words, it is not full of bells and whistles, but if you are just looking for a solid gaming combo for a low price than you really can't beat this combo.The keyboard has a solid construction despite being all plastic, and the keys have great tactile feedback, probably the best I have experienced for a non-mechanical keyboard. It is precise and responsive. The one complain I have with the keyboard is something other reviewers have already mentioned; the enter key is that strange ""tall"" type that relocates the ""\"" key next to it instead of above it. In my case this is not a big deal at all because I do not use that key often, but I could see it being a problem if I did so you will want to be aware. The ability to swap the arrow and WASD keys is neat, but for me it is just a gimmick as I always use WASD when gaming anyway. With the feet down, the keyboard sits at a nice angle and I have been able to game for periods of 4+ hours without any discomfort.Moving on to the mouse, I bought this combo originally because my Logitech G9 I have been using for the last 5 years got spilled on, and shorted out. I loved that mouse and at the time I paid $70 for it when I bought it. Now that I am married and with a child, I do not have $70 to spend on a mouse, so I came to amazon to look for decent gaming mouse. My budget was $30. After some research I came across this combo. ""#1 best selling keyboard and mouse combo on amazon?"" I thought. I had never heard of this brand and 5 years ago when I bought my Logitech, there was no such thing as an off brand making a quality product so I was a bit skeptical at first. However, after reading the comments I thought... ""What the hell, it's $30. I will give it a shot and if I am not thrilled, I can buy another one once I get my tax return"". Now that I have rambled my story to you I will tell you how I feel about the mouse. Now, I will not lie... It is no G9. That mouse had the perfect set of weights and DPI settings that just felt amazing, but at $70 that was the expectation. With that in mind, I will say that this mouse is the second best mouse I have used. The DPI settings are nice, though for me the highest one is way too fast so I use the middle setting normally, and the lowest setting for precision such as sniping (the buttons on top of the mouse to adjust DPI on demand are great for this). The mouse is very smooth, the left and right click as well as the other buttons all have a great feel to them. I play games that require a very high CPM, so I am jamming on the right click constantly, probably at least 100 times per minute, and it is always responsive and catches every click with ease. The mouse wheel works fine, I have no issue with it... Not much to say here other than that it functions as it should.TL;DR: Both the keyboard and mouse are worth the price alone IMO, to get both for the price is just icing on the cake. I am highly satisfied with my purchase and would strongly recommend this combo to anyone. I have already recommended it to friends if they should ever need an economic solution to replacing any of the gaming keyboards/mice.",31
Ernest L. Johnson III,4.0," June 3, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"For, what I'd call, an ""entry level"" set, inexpensive, fairly solid with good feedback on keys and DPI on mouse.I'll give ReDragon props for flashy.  This is one flashy keyboard, the solid backlight setting is great, especially gaming in low-light. I still have attempted the ""changes color with each keystroke"" but would likely be a strobe effect.Warning: There is no downloadable software, all the settings are manually done at the Keyboard or Mouse. The only reason I can't give it a 5-star. This is why it is a good entry level gaming setup. No macros to program, it would be up to the game to keymap, but macros are out. The DPI setting on the mouse resets each time you shutdown/restart the computer, so you just need to click the DPI selection button. Same goes with the Keyboard, the FN Home, or FN END will change the backlighting. The instructions have a page on which each does.I'm not a fan of the ""no memory"" aspect of the keyboard and mouse, but the cable length, funcitionality and feel of the keyboard, a well weighted full sized mouse. Oh, cable length is good to longer than expected, I think about 5'. The mouse cable is braided.It's really not a bad set, I might get one of ReDragon's higher end KB/Mouse over the more ""common"" brands out there. Sometimes you just need a flashy keyboard and mouse and don't want to spend a ton on something else that is really only marginally better than this one. :-)",3

BK,1.0," March 11, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"I wasn't expecting much for $30 but this keyboard exceeded all expections for me.  Firstly, I didn't realize how horribly laggy and imprecise my wireless keyboard and mouse were.  The one game i play on my PC was completely transformed as I discovered it was my horrible wireless devices that made me a bad player.  LOL.  Secondly, once you figure out how to disable the silly flashing rainbow default lighting setup, you have a brilliant backlit keyboard with a complete range of colors and lighting schemes to use in different lighting environments.  Finally, those that miss the old mechanical IBM keyboards, this $30 keyboard comes surprisingly close to replicating a good amount of the mechanical feel I miss so much from them.  And you don't have to pay close to $200 to get some of that back.  The Keyboard layout is largely the classic IBM layout as well.  The quibbles I have are minor considering this is a $30 backlit keyboard and 3,600 dpi gaming mouse.  1) The top half of the symbols above the number keys are dimly lit.  Not a huge issue but annoying.  2) The keyboard keys are very light to the touch which some people might like.  I miss the old heft and sturdiness of the old IBM mechanical keyboard keys.  But hey, for $30....  3)  Some silly graphics and lighting on the mouse but then again, only $30....I would highly recommend this to anyone getting fed up with their wireless chiclet keyboard and glitchy wireless mouse.  It's also a cheap test of a 3,600 dpi gaming mouse and keyboard to see if there really is a difference between standard keyboards and mice and gaming dedicated hardware.  There definitely is a difference.  .UPDATE -  Malfunctioning after 5 months.  Too bad.  You get what you pay for.  Down arrow key is not working.  The left mouse button sometimes fails to click.  The right mouse button sometimes clicks by itself.",3
Chargeit,3.0," September 6, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"Picked up this set to include with a computer I'm selling. Took it out to take pictures and am not very impressed. The keyboard is alright, feels cheap but decent enough. The mouse however is very plastic feeling. Would say for a cheap set the keyboard is fine but the mouse leaves a lot to be desired.The RGB on the keyboard is poor. I have some very high end mech rgb keyboards and those flow like water. This keyboard more of flashes. The issue I see is the color is broken up into zones, aka 3 or 4 rows of keys meaning there's a jerky flow to its movement. Honestly, I think they'd of been better off just making the keyboard sold colors.The mouse led is stuck at red. Personally not a fan of black and red in 2019 (2013 called, they want their gaming colors back). Though my largest issue with the led on the mouse is it breaths and I can't figure out how to make it a solid color.Overall I'd say this is a cheap, budget keyboard + mouse set and it looks and feels like that.

JPK17,1.0," July 5, 2017",Reviewed in the United States ,"This is far far below the level expected.  I rarely give a bad review but this is awful.  The buttons are mushy and give poor feedback to being struck, they feel like they sightly stick upon being pressed so typing regularly is difficult.

ShadowDragon8685,2.0," September 19, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"This keyboard and mouse work. They're perfectly serviceable. The light options on the keyboard are nice. That's the extent of the good things I can say about this set, unfortunately.To start with, the mouse. I thought I was getting a five-button gaming mouse (not including scroll wheel): I did not. The two side buttons are MACRO playback buttons that require Redragon's propriety and obviously-machine-translated software to function. The macro function sucks because it doesn't have good manual editing; you cannot type in a set of instructions to push X button at Y time, etc, etc, the way you could with AutoHotKey. You have to record all the keystrokes in the correct order and manually edit the timing/delete anything. But you cannot add!You CAN assign the side buttons - and, for that matter, the regular Mouse1 and Mouse2 buttons - to other keys. However, you CANNOT simply assign them to, say, Mouse3 or Mouse4, as those options are anomalously missing. You may only assign it to Left or Right Mouse, or a bunch of special windows keys like IE Forward/Back, Multimedia, Mouse1/Mouse2, Internet Explorer special keys, and the like.The middle button, below the mousewheel and between the left and right mouse keys, is not a mouse button! ALL it does is swap between one of four programmable mouse input DPI steps. This seems mostly superflous to me, as you can set the mouse's DPI in the software. I wouldn't mind so much if ""switch between DPI settings"" was an OPTION and I could reclaim that button for, say, Mouse5, but nope! That is absolutely, positively ALL it does.The keyboard has some FANCY light options, I'll give it that. The instruction book is reasonably helpful at explaining them all, too. Annoyingly, they're only a set of input-based options from the keyboard's own function key, and NOT programmable via the software - which has nothing at all to do with the keyboard. Furthermore, the mouse only has one color - red - and you can only choose between light on, light off, and if it is on, change the speed of the mouse light's breathing. These products are obviously not made as partners, they're just two different products manufactured by the same company and sold as a set.The keyboard, also, feels cheap. See also the damage on the S, D, N, M, and . keys in my picture above. I have only had this keyboard about six months (arrived mid-April 2019, photograph taken mid-September 2019, day before the date-of-posting since midnight has just passed as I am typing this,) and it's already visibly worn from use. This is the kind of keyboard that's made to be unboxed immediately before a PC gaming pro sets down for a tournament, it doesn't feel like it's going to stand up to two decades of wear and still be functional the way my last keyboard was - and still is, though filthy and with many keys worn physically through. I bought this combo for the mouse, which, speaking of cheapness;The mouse is also bloody cheap, too. It FEELS nice and solid and thunky and heavy in your hand - that's because there's a bloody great mass of sodding metal weights inside it! You can pull them out to adjust their spacing and numbering if you like, so that's nice I guess, but with them all out, if just looks feels like a generic Logitech corded mouse going through a Goth phase.In conclusion, they work, they're cheap enough and if you like ""gaming"" stuff, or dragons, or black, or colors, or fancy rainbow cycling lights and you need to replace either or both of a keyboard or mouse, they'll do the job. But do not expect a gaming mouse (it is not,) or a gaming keyboard (it has literally no gaming features whatever.)",4
Sajeev M.,5.0," October 31, 2014",Reviewed in the United States ,"Everything arrived very promptly and undamaged. The mouse is excellent and a great step up from the standard optical mouse I had been using. It has 3 DPI settings and offers easy switching in game. The mouse responds very well and has weight adjustment for those who like a heavier mouse. The design is very nice and overall its very comfortable for long gaming sessions. The keyboard is also great. It offers media keys integrated with the function keys and also allows you to re-map your regular arrow keys into the wasd keys which can be very useful for some games. The back light is fairly bright without being annoying and helps while gaming in a dark room. Overall, this bundle is outstanding for its low cost. It offers many features that you would not normally get at this price point and I have noticed an improvement in my gaming with this mouse. Everything also looks very sleek and nice. Great bundle for the price.",109
DaLooney,3.0," January 7, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"Although as a kb it's on the 'normal' side (no issues) there are a some (IMO) large 'niggly' points.First, no configuration (software) for the kb.  This means every time you shutdown/reboot all your 'settings' revert to default. so you have to change the settings back to the way you want, EVERY TIME you restart/reboot your system, this equals a PITA.Secondly, ergonomically, the foot rests when fully extended only change the inclination of the kb by about 5% and don't make it any easier to use, especially for those of us who can touch type.  The higher the inclination, the less 'reaching' you have to do to get the 'top row' keys (numbers, etc) and you can forget trying to reach the function key row completely.For the money spent you can get a better 'combo' than this with better configuration setup and better 'ergonomics' than this kb.As far as I'm concerned, it's overpriced (even at such a low price) so my advice - save your money, go elsewhere.Cheers",2
Holly Kraft,1.0," December 18, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"I was very taken by the look and durability reviews to purchase this item and up til this morning was quite happy with it. I went to log in this morning and suddenly the Ctrl, Alt and delete keys weren’t working. Having recently gotten a new laptop from work I thought perhaps it was just a fluke. However once logging in, when typing I noticed other keys not working (you never realize how many times you use the letter h til you don’t have it..).While the lights in the keyboard were still working, I tried the keyboard in several other USB ports, still nothing.I even tried in another laptop and by then, no keys were working.I had this JUST over three months and used less than 10 times during that period.Needless to say I’m quite disappointed that the product wasn’t very durable. Since it hardly stood up to general office standards, I certainly wouldn’t think to use it for gaming of any kind either.",8
Scott Johnson,3.0," April 16, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"The keyboard and mouse are alright, they do just what they're supposed to by typing and clicking. The lights on the keyboard are fairly easy to change and nothing is out of place. I will agree with some  comments that the wrist rest is awkward, it's just long enough to hit the palm of your hand but too short to rest on it.My biggest complaint is that the software downloads are non-existent or difficult to find. If you search S101-3, there are no software downloads. I eventually found that the mouse is actually a M601-3 Centrophorus Mouse and downloading the software for that will allow you to customize the keys, record macros, etc. I haven't done much with that, I did try to map the side buttons to skip songs and it didn't work. If you find the keyboard, the software doesn't recognize the keyboard at all. The closes I could find was the K503 RGB LED keyboard.The other issue is when power is shut off, the lights revert to the ""demo mode"" and the mouse sensitivity reverts to the slowest speed, so that whenever you restart your computer you have to reset these. It wouldn't be such a big deal, but the keyboard goes into a flashing light show that's just annoying.If I had to do it again, I would probably get a different one. I'll use this one until it gives out since it works as a keyboard and mouse.",3
Shaun Thomas-Arnold,5.0," December 19, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"Quality is about what you would expect for a $15 keyboard and $10 mouse, but with the added features of backlighting and macro/dpi for the mouse. Not really ""gaming"" quality, although the software does offer macro creation (see walkthrough below for software use).Keyboard:This is a tall button, ANSI format keyboard with double function F-keys (volume, play, email, etc). The tall keys can be bothersome if you're a writer, but the feedback is good and they are fairly quiet. I can type next to my sleeping toddler without waking her up. The lighting function controls were easy enough to figure out and has rainbow, rainbow shift, steady solid color, and solid color breath settings (and off). Color control is done with Function+Ins,Del,Home,End,PgUp,PgDwMouse:Red color breath or off settings. You can adjust the breath speed and on/off with the software. Mouse click is audible, but not super loud like some cheap junk mice. Button clicks are a little sensitive so if you rest your hand on the mouse you might find yourself clicking them on accident. DPI function works fine out the gate, can be further adjusted with software. Side button assignments require the software to change.for software go to the redragonusa site, downloads section.Use the M601 driver (you can tell by the picture). It's a .rar file so if you can't access it you will need something like 7zip (freeware). Once you install that everything is self explantatory except the macro creation. You can find how to videos if you search it.Basically, go to Macro Manager section > Create new > click the ""Record"" button in the bottom right > Type in your macro (ie Ctrl+C ) > Click Record again to stop > Go to Button Assign section > select Macro from the left drop down box > select your macro in the right drop down.Note: just got this so no idea about longevity as yet. Hope this was helpful :)",3
RyanB,5.0," November 17, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"They keyboard is easy to type on.  The color choices are great (7 colors), and nice to have extra options like rainbow, pulse, etc.  I just put mine on solid white because I'm boring, but my kids like the other settings.  By the way, other reviewers might say you can't do this... but you can.  Just press Fn+Home repeatedly to select your solid color, and if it's ""breathing"" press Fn+End to turn off the breathing feature.The mouse is GREAT!  Very smooth, and I didn't realize how much I needed a DPI button until I got one!  This is the first time I've had a mouse where you can select the sensitivity right there on the mouse!  Awesome!The weights are superfluous for me... I just left them in.  I tried taking them out to see if I noticed a difference, and it does become noticeably lighter, but I'd rather just keep them in there so I don't lose them, and so the mouse doesn't fall off the keyboard tray by being pulled by the cord.All mouse buttons work with Windows 10 without installing anything, which is very nice.  Right and left buttons work as normal, wheel scrolls up/down and if you click the wheel it pops up an auto-scroll feature which I am also very much enjoying.  The two thumb buttons do page forward/back in browsers (not sure what they do in other apps).  Overall I use all the buttons, and they have made me more productive (I bought the set so I could work at night without keeping the light on).  Note that the wheel does NOT lean side-to-side.  Would be nice if it did, but certainly not a big deal for me (normally this behavior would invoke a horizontal scrolling function).Also I noticed that some reviewers find the underlining on the keys to be annoying since not all the keys have underlines on them.  I believe this is to indicate which keys are ""non-conflict"" keys.  It says in the manual that you can press up to 19 of these non-conflict keys at the same time and they will all operate normally.  This doesn't make sense from a business perspective (who needs to type two letters at the same time?) but when gaming it makes a HUGE difference.  Gamers will use WASD to move their character around, space to jump, and nearby keys to do other things like cast spells, fire weapons, select things, etc.  So it is very common to be pressing 3, 4, or 5 of these keys at the same time, and if you're really good you can press even more (each finger can press 2 or 3 keys at the same time by pressing between the keys, and you can even use your palm to press Ctrl).  Another bonus for gamers is the ability to disable the windows key (aka the Windows key of sadness, since accidentally pressing it while in a game will immediately make you lose control of the game).Overall I am VERY happy with the keyboard and mouse.  The only suggestion I have for the vendor (that isn't mentioned above already) is that it would be nice to have dedicated volume keys that don't require the use of the Fn key.  You can do vol-/+ by pressing Fn+F2/F3, but it's impossible to do that combination with one hand (they are too far apart), and hard to do without looking at the keyboard.  There are 10 specialty keys on this keyboard, and I will probably never use any of them... so it's a bit disappointing that the dedicated volume keys are missing, because I would absolutely use them if they were there.  I mean come on, F5 already does a refresh by itself, why do you need another dedicated key to do the same thing?  Not a big deal, just a minor annoyance, and certainly not even worth dinging a star for.",1

I’ve tried everything to get it to work. With no luck. Now I’m just waiting for my other one to go out. 😡 it’s been too long to return it. So now I am just out the money spent.

AnthonyS,2.0," May 15, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Where to begin...well lets start with the good. The keyboard and mouse are quite comfortable. I loved the weight of the mouse. Yep, that's all of the good currently. As for the bad: No software came in the packaging. I had to google the software which took me to a youtube video where I found a link. Problem is that the website you go to doesn't specifically list this combo. Installing the mouse software was smooth. It had all your typical button settings and a macro manager. Problem is that one of the ""programmable buttons"" did not show up in the software. That middle chevron button next to the wheel was not listed. The keyboard software didn't even detect the keyboard, so didn't get a chance to make any adjustments. I tried to get everything to work for an hour before giving up. But here is the really odd thing. I have 3 screen. The mouse pointer stopped at the edge of each screen. Yeah totally odd. I fooled around with various settings and got it to work then rebooted. On reboot, none of my mouse settings were saved, and oddly, two of my monitors were no longer recognized by Win10. I decided to go back to scratch so uninstalled the software and drivers., connected my old mouse and keyboard, rebooted...and everything returned to normal.

Nis,5.0," July 21, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"So I've used Razer keyboards for gaming for years but the quality/price ration wasn't great so I decided to try something else. I found this and was a bit skeptical but oh wow I was impressed! As an avid gamer who spends most of her free time typing, gaming and on the computer in general I'm thoroughly impressed. The keys are soft to the touch, silent and responsive. The lighting is good, if you type in the dark it's really helpful! The colors can be changed to be crazy RGB running all over, or a soft neutral color (i picked white) as the backlight. Fully adjustable.The only negative I have is the mouse. I wasn't intending to buy a mouse but figured I'd try it. I'm a fairly small girl with small hands but this mouse is pretty small for even me. Not unusable but I definitely prefer the larger mice that are a little more comfortable on the hand. Otherwise as far as quality/price...BUY IT. Seriously.

7 Dead,1.0," July 24, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Read the reviews of the keyboard and mouse combo, so I ordered it to replace my Cool Master Devastator II that a few keys stopped working after 4 years. I was happy to get package, so I could get back to my work. I do play games, and also I am a writer and artist and use my computer for both.Checked their website to see if there any drives to download, seen there was one so I downloaded it. Plugged in both keyboard and mouse, at first everything seemed to work fine, about after 10 minutes, my music player started going crazy cycling through the playlist that I was playing. I unplugged and than plugged it in again, and it solved the problem. About a week later I moved the keyboard a little and it started cycling through music tracks again, but I was not even playing music at the time. I did same thing unplugged and plugged in. Now it happens every few days if on its own, or if you move the keyboard. It is a bit annoying, That is just the first issue.The second issue out of nowhere both the keyboard and mouse will disconnect and go black. I tried to unplug and plug in and it did nothing, so I had to do a hard reset on my computer losing all the work I did on an art project I was working on, all because there was no way to save with both keyboard and mouse not working.

D. Drummond,5.0," June 30, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"I was looking for a lighted keyboard to put on my home theater PC, that I've found I am gaming on that big screen here more lately.  I was just using an old basic HP keyboard I had laying around, but given I use this in the dark it was of course impossible to see the keys with just the light from the screen.On my main desktop I have a Razer Black Widow, and I love it, so I have something to compare this one to. I didn't want to spend that much on a keyboard for the home theater PC, but still wanted the backlight.I ended up buying this one based solely on the Amazon ratings, and quite frankly, I didn't have very high expectations.  I figured it was Amazon, and if the keyboard was total crap, I could return it anyway.  Boy, was I surprised when it arrived!For a keyboard at this price point, I was very happy to see if felt like, while very lightweight, decent construction.  Amazon shipped it in it's bare box with no outer box, and of course the box was all dinged up from shipping, and I expected it to be broken, but it was just fine.Even more surprising were my first impressions of the mouse. Just the feel of it, it felt like a much more expensive mouse, and having a braided cable at this price point is fantastic.  I wasn't even expecting to use the mouse, as I have a trackball, I mostly just bought this for the keyboard.I haven't tried the mouse in actual use yet, probably going to give it to a friend, but the keyboard suites my needs very nicely. The adjustments of the RGB LEDs are easy to do right on the keyboard.  They key feel of course is softer than the Razer I am used to on my desktop, but I was happy to learn that this brand has a higher end keyboard available with those type of keys, I might purchase in the future.Bottom line, very pleased with this purchase.",1

Commander579,4.0," May 29, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Initial findings.I love the “soft” brushed coating on the keyboard it feels nice and over all is very comfortable ergonomically when typing. The keys have good resistance, footprint and travel. They feel like I’m actually hitting keys vs buttons like some smaller keyboards.The lighting effects are fun with a wide range of settings and can turn them off or dim them as needed with a couple keystrokes. Over all a solid buy for the cost.As for the mouse, while not the main reason I bought this setup, it seems like a mild afterthought. The plastic is hard and stiff making it feel like it wasn’t finished, the components like buttons, edging and grips are uneven making it feel like it was put together wrong, the weight and over all feel reminds me of a cheap generic stock mouse you would find in a computer lab or office that came with the dell still running windows 7, that’s made to barely serve a purpose. and nothing more. The finish is textured to give a better grip, but unlike the soft almost silicon texture of the keyboard, the surface feels hard and abrasive. Even the “silicon” grips feel like hard plastic.I do appreciate the sensitivity toggle option for the curser. Having duel screens and a higher sensitivity is amazingly helpful. But every time the computer is put to sleep or turned off cutting power to the mouse the setting goes back to the low sensitivity default so every time I have to reset it.Finally my biggest complaint and the reason for the 4 star review is the mouse is so loud and clicky I cant use the mouse with any open mics because it will wash out any other sound coming through.Over all if you just need a solid keyboard or need a mouse and keyboard combo for general use. Not a bad option. Just expect to be getting a better mouse down the road.",1

The next problem is the keys are hard to read if you rely on the back lighting, for example, the letters are fine but anything like the number keys, which have a number on the bottom and a !@#$% etc. on the top are nearly impossible to read. Then, there's the fact that it doesn't save your color/lighting settings, if you disconnect the keyboard or don't use it for a few days it goes back to the default, annoying, flashing rainbow. If these things don't bother you then this combo is otherwise fine, especially for the price, but I was expecting better after seeing all of these positive reviews.",1
Devon Day,5.0," October 4, 2018",Reviewed in the United States ,"Honestly, there's not a lot to say about this keyboard and mouse combo. For the most part, it's a no frills combo that will get the job done for us gamers on a budget. I've been using the combo to play extended sessions of Ring of Elysium, and I haven't missed a beat.Keyboard feels great to type on, and has a decent sound when keys are pressed, which is satisfying. I really like the RBG as well.The mouse is fairly light, even with the weights installed. But it feels very precise and smooth. I also enjoy that there's a program to download that lets you do some small customization such as setting up macros, changing DPI (up to 3200), and changing the speed of the breathing affect for the red LED.Overall, this is a basic, and inexpensive, solution for PC gaming. Hard to go wrong.UPDATE 12/36/18:Took me some time to get around to making this update. Life has been a bit of a pain lately, but it hasn't stopped me just yet.Anyway, I had an issue just a month or two ago, in which a bowl of cereal spilled all over my keyboard. In a panic, I dove under my desk, and unplugged it. I then promptly took it to my kitchen sink, and ran it under some water to help clean out the milk. This is when I noticed the holes on the bottom. I hadn't realized that this keyboard is liquid resistance, but I was sure glad because I really wanted a milk-free keyboard experience.Just to stay safe, I went ahead and let the keyboard sit and dry, with a fan pointed directly on it, for a couple of weeks.I'm happy to say that, after it had time to dry, and I finished cleaning up any dried milk left behind, the keyboard is functioning as well as it did out of the box.Good going Redragon! Nice to have a liquid resistant keyboard at such a low price.",2
James7,4.0," September 13, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"First, this review is for the replacement keyboard. The first one, the space bar didn't work, but the style and design are good, I figured I'd give it another try.Disclaimer, I have not tried as a gaming keyboard functions yet. This review is just for regular keyboard and mouse function.-Pros: Quiet, good feel while typing, keys feel like a mechanical keyboard without the loud clicking, back lighting is descent.  A nice looking unit.The mouse is stylish, and will work good ""as is"" but you need to download the free driver and suite (suite loads with the driver). once suite is loaded the mouse becomes very adjustable to your needs.-Cons: Had read other buyers say they had same problem with space bar and other other keys. To me, a keyboard should be about typing first, everything else second. Just me. but this second one works is great. Can't find anything else to complain about, but again this doesn't cover the gaming functions.The mouse. The mouse comes with the LED set to ""slow"" pulse. so if you don't download the driver (suite built in) you have a standard mouse with a red ""heart beat"" back light (default setting). Yes, the light for the mouse can only be controlled from the suite! As I stated it was free Red Dragon site, and installed quick and easy....on my personal laptop.I work remote now and work on a company computer as well. I usually just pop the USB hub from one to the other.But can't put the driver on work computer. Enter mouse with a red ""heart beat"" light for 8 hours.Good for your personal computer, but probably not for a work environment. Will have to live with it for now.Included instructions are basic at best, and even going on YouTube couldn't find a lot of help with what all the programmable/gaming keys could do.-Overall, good value for the price, as my son sent over $120 on his gaming keyboard (SMH).I would just advise to buy ""sold by Amazon"" as I got my replacement within two days.Updated (09/14/2020) On work computer, running large cad program and multiple file docs, along with other programs. The mouse was very glitchy. I realized running though the USB hub made the mouse commands even moving the cursor  “wait in line” to be executed. Not a long delay, but long enough to be aggravating. Computer is brand new, top self HP. So not the computer. Never had this problem with my wireless trackball mouse, with dongle plugged into hub. Not sure if this is all wired mouses or just this one. But I plugged it straight into one of the computers USB ports and now it works fine. Just a heads up. Might be the same for gaming.",0
Dave,4.0," June 1, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"I guess I got my money's worth. The default setting for this keyboard and mouse is to come up blinking all colors. . And every time you turn on your computer, you have to select a color scheme or work on a blinking keyboard.  Also, sometimes, the caps-lock light goes out of sync between keyboard and computer.  Specially when using a remote desktop app. Very strange.  Finally, I've noticed that if I step away from my computer for a while (1 or 2 hours), I'm very likely to come back to an unresponsive keyboard. It looses contact with the PC.  I have to restart my computer. I have no proof that the keyboard is causing this. These things don't occur a lot (except the blinking).  But .. I'm probably going to save some money and buy a new keyboard.. I miss my old Logitech G11",1
Joe,5.0," January 8, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"I use my keyboard anywhere from 8-16 hours a day most days.  I work in a dimly lit room at night and need a backlit keyboard that I can see, but doesn't blind me, and that will last.  Others I've had in the past had painted keycaps that would wear off within 6 months to a year.  I purchased a different brand before I bought this one, then gave the other one away because the backlight wouldn't stay on due to an unadvertised ""auto-off"" feature that could not be disabled.This keybaord is perfect for me.  I love the backlight. There are several modes, but I always set it to a single color and choose my preferred brightness.  It's bright enough without being obnoxious, but it can be turned up to be very bright if you wish.  The keys are average height, they are fairly quiet; they do make noise, but it's not the super loud clacky noise that some keyboards make.  The media buttons work well, but are unobtrusive and require no extra drivers or software.I love this keyboard, and my only nitpick is one of style:  Many keys have an alternate function via the function key.  The symbol representing the alternate function is printed at the BOTTOM of each key, meaning the primary function of these keys is printed at the top of the keys.  Due to the angle at which you see the keyboard (since it's in front of you) the bottom half othe keys are better lit than the top of the keys, so the alternate functions show up better than the primary functions of the keys.  For example, on the arrow keys, the alternate functions for backlight brightness are perfectly backlit, while the arrows themselves are dim.  While this is a minor nitpick, I would prefer to have hte primary function on the bottom of the keys with the alternate function printed above.All in all, even with my nitpick I would definitely buy this keyboard again.",0

   I purchased this since I am now working from home and do a lot of computer work. I wanted something to break up my day and have fun with, but still needed something functional. The key strokes on the keyboard are so soft and smooth, it is quieter than my regular ergonomic keyboard. The lighting to it is very nice and there are so many ways to have it. It does take a while to learn which key functions to use to get it to where you may want it, but it is a very easy instruction manual. Since I am not using this for gaming I will say I am really glad that I did read the reviews and purchase this. I did have an issue with one of the keys sticking, but when I contacted the seller they responded immediately and were ever so happy without question to replace it. I contacted Amazon and after scanning my return had my replacement keyboard sent out the same day and received it the following day. I will definitely recommend this to anyone that is looking for a great keyboard and will see what other items they may have to assist with my new home office.",1
IMorrow,3.0," January 8, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"The build on both keyboard and mouse feels solid, and neither feel like they were cheaply made. They're very comfortable to use, and just feel nice.What I really don't like is how they're controlled. The mouse has multiple DPI stages that can be cycled through, but the stage that it defaults to when powered on is way too low right out of the box. There were a few other changes that I wanted to make, but it didn't come with any drivers or software. I hunted around and found that the driver software for the M601 also work, since the mouse is identical. It now appears that software is included, but it was a nuisance for me.The keyboard suffers from the same issue, however. It appears to be the same as the K503, but there is no software to control it. This means none of the extra keys can be keymapped to anything other than the out-of-the-box function, and (what's most annoying) you can't change the default lighting. Every time it powers on, it defaults to the RGB rainbow wave rolling across the keys, which is annoying. Having to change it manually using the Fn key combos every time is a bit aggravating. I get that some people will probably like the fact that it doesn't require special software to use, the way Razer or Logitech do, but it'd at least be nice if it could remember what the last used settings were when it gets powered off.",3
Thunder Struck,4.0," November 8, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"I like the set and I will keep it, but I do have some complaints, The amazon descriptions says software is included. That's not true. You have to go to the website which they do not give the web address in the directions. you have to download a zip installer to be able to open the mouse files that you download. I spent a long time trying to find the drivers and then figuring out how to open the file.  The mouse is a M106 but that's not what it says on the back of the mouse. The lights on the keyboard are not very bright. There are several different colors but you can not choose one color and keep it, it has to scroll through all 7 colors. my keyboard had a manual but my mouse did not and directions are very basic and generic. Keep in mind a young person will have no problem but if your somewhat older you will struggle a bit.",1
MDN,4.0," April 20, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"This is a normal keyboard.  I bought in anticipation of replacing another keyboard that was giving me problems.  About 30 days later my old keyboard, was having a problem with a few keys including the return key and I was happy to have this keyboard ready.  I thought it would have some ergonomic qualities.  It has little legs you can set up to change the angle of the keyboard and that is about the extent of its ergonomic characteristics.  The keys are super smooth, so they are a little slippery for me.  My hands are a little on the dry side.  I bought this keyboard, because I thought it was a good deal for an ergonomic keyboard and did not really pay too much attention to the gaming aspect of it.  It has flashing lights that are kind of annoying, but if you read the instruction manual you can adjust them to a single color, flashing and non-flashing or no light at all.  It is very hard to see without a light, though.  Not sure how it will work at night, but I think it will work nicely and in that regard I think it offers something not on my previous keyboard.  In daytime hours it is hard to see the keys, as the characters are not painted on, but are rather are see through .  I would not recommend for anyone  looking for an ergonomic keyboard.  At first I was unhappy with it, but once I figured how to adjust the lights I am okay with it and are actually happy I can use it at night without additional lighting.  The fact that it came with a mouse is an additional bonus, so yeah I would buy again for the price, but I think if I could fight an ergonomic keyboard for the same price I would buy ergonomic.",0
Emile,3.0," June 19, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Update, July 20, 2020,After several emails with the company regarding my issues with their product they agreed to refund me for the keyboard and shipping & handling.They did make several attempts to replace the keyboard and mouse, but due to the nature of my issues, I didnt want to take a chance. I've upgraded their rating to 3 stars because the design and look of the keyboard & mouse was cool and they obviously stand behind their products and did their best to try and appease me. Thanks Red Dragon.Bought this keyboard a few months ago because it looked stylish and seemed to have good reviews. Upon receiving and opening the package I was happy.  Fast forward a few weeks later and my pc was turning itself on every night. I did a wake command and determined it was my keyboard and mouse causing it. I tried to go into the device settings and disable it but it would happen again anyway.  I reached out to the company and they did respond quickly and offered a refund.  I thought lemme try to deal and see if it would stop. Fast forward a month and not only has the problem not stopped, now the mouse works intermittently. Whether the pc was on and in use or just powered on the mouse wouldn't work. I'd have 2 unplug and plug it back in. I have 8 USB ports on my pc and I had the issue with every single one. So I reached out to take them up on the offer for credit and was denied because it was beyond the 30 day return period.  Even though they were aware of my issues and offered a previous refund. They offered to exchange it but I'd have to pay to return the defective equipment.  That's when I lost it. Buy at ur own risk. This keyboard and mouse has only caused me stress!",1
Zachary H.,4.0," May 16, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"After Abusing this keyboard and mouse with hardcore gaming, I can say that it's Overall a good buy. There are some things to note for the Nerdy Peeps out there. (I just bought this order again)-The Keyboard's rubber backing under the keys is one large piece across the entire board. In other words, you will not easily be able to replace a key membrane with another one.- The mouse is good. However, the first to go, over time, was the mouse wheel (Which was just terrible from the start), and then the primary and secondary keys. Surprisingly, the side keys on the mouse held out very well despite me using them quite often to voice chat and use a melee punch feature in Overwatch. (A Game)- The Mouse and Keyboard have high durable cords and attachments . Simply amazing.- Overall, for the price, This Mouse and Keyboard is outstanding.

I am a little leery about products that come from overseas but I figured, for the price, why not? Well, I should have listened to my gut because we got a bad product. The keyboard works great...(It's a keyboard... not hard to do) and the mouse functioned pretty well while it lasted, except less than 90 days after I purchased it died, total death, I played with the wiring up near the USB port by moving it with my hand..it flickered on for a brief second before dying, so I can only assume the wires came loose like oh-so-many ear buds I've had before... This is sad because this mouse was almost always in the usb port giving no reason for there to be unwanted stress on the mouse.Edit: In response to my review and my complaint, Amazon shipped me another keyboard/mouse combo to replace the broken mouse, they shipped it one day so that I have already received the new product and am shipping the faulty combo back, this is great service on the part of Amazon and even ChallengerUSA (the distributor), whom also offered to replace the item.

Alexander,5.0," March 7, 2016",Reviewed in the United States ,"You wont go wrong for the price. Just like anything else that you buy through Amazon Prime this guy came to my home quickly. Everything was packed up nicely and well protected with air bags covering the actual keyboard and mouse packaging. Granted, this isn't going to be the best keyboard mouse combo out there but for the price, I don't think you'll find anything better out there. The red lights looks good on both the keyboard and mouse but aren't too bright. The mouse wheel has a nice feel to it but does require a little bit more umph to move it then other mouses sometimes need. The mouse definitely isn't small, but I only have normal size hands for a guy and my handle cradles it just fine. If anyone out there with small hands is wondering if they can use this, my wife (with VERY small hands) says that she really likes how comfortable the mouse is.  The 3 dpi setting are nice and luckily with where the button to change the dpi settings is at, you're not going to accidentally hit it. It's also nice for me switching to a lower or higher dpi depending on the game that I'm playing or the program that I'm using. If you have any questions or anything I'll be happy to answer anyone's about the keyboard or mouse.***EDIT*** I've decided to update this review. After putting in about 200 hours of CS:GO using this keyboard and mouse set up, I feel like I've put it through it's paces. The only issue that I've come up with was binding keys to the mouse buttons 4 and 5. They're a little tough only because instead of using the options menu I had to manually type in the binds through the console. Other than that I've had no issues. The Keyboard is a bit on the louder side but not much more than any mechanical keyboard albeit much louder than a chiclet keyboard would be, but that's to be expected. As far as how noisy it is when I'm gaming, since I'm really only using WASD a bit of the shift key and then tab, I haven't had much noise. The most important thing is that the wife doesn't get annoyed with the noise so there's that. 200 hours later this is still a 5 star extreme bang for the buck keyboard/mouse setup.",4

The keyboard and mouse work perfectly for this purpose (which is why I evaluate this more like a gaming controller than as a full-on keyboard-and-mouse).It has some odd behaviors like, for example, when I reboot my system it often will not see the keyboard and mouse, and I have to re-plug them. I don't know if this is due to this kit, or to my hardware, though I've never had that problem before with other mice.Although this has RGB, it is ""primative""-- it may or may not fit your needs. It isn't programmable, and there isn't any PC-side software for it. It has several modes you toggle through with a key combination, and then a separate key combination lets you cycle through colors (when appropriate for the particular effect).

I was WRONG about:- This keyboard (S101-3) DOES NOT have supported software.- The lighting controls are done from the keyboard itself.SO when I plugged this keyboard and immediately the keyboard started streaming colors across the keys...WHAT IS GOING ON. This should NOT be the default. Anyways, I looked online for software, but there is none. Then I tried to use the lighting controls on the keyboard and could not figure it out. I had to pull out the manual (see pictures) and I'm copying it here for reference. Hopefully this helps you like it helped me.So there IS a way to choose solid colors. And there IS a way to cycle through colors WITHOUT breathing (which I prefer).Cons:- No software- Confusing when first using.Pros:- QUIET. I know this is a mesh keyboard, but man is this so much quieter than my mechanical keyboard.- LOTS of buttons. I kinda geek out a little about all the options to control things from the push of a button right from the keyboard and this has lots of that.So even though I just started using this I think it will grow on me.

Apparently, Red Dragon doesn't include drivers for these and they are ""supposed"" to auto find the drivers. They do not.

Everyday I spend an unusual amount of time just getting everything reloaded to where it works correctly. But each day it is a problem. The keyboard keys do not know their function. Sometimes every key is an ""Enter"". Sometimes the shift key only works depending on if it is left or right and which other key you are trying to use. i.e. the right shift works with letters, the left shift only works with numbers. It makes typing impossible. It will randomly get stuck on Enter no matter what key you hit.

Simple, I needed to use my computer, at night, without turning the room lights on.  I didn't need all the fancy lighting schemes, but a simple white works very nicely.  The keyboard is well constructed and the keys give you the feel that you need.  They aren't completely silent, but the sound level is definitely no objectionable.  The extra keys at the top are quite handy.  If I want to nitpick, the only negative I can find is that the contrast between the characters and the key's background, is not as great as it could be in some room lighting conditions, but hey, that's what backlighting is for.  BTW, the keys are easily read with the backlighting.The mouse fits my hand perfectly.  The old one that came with my computer was too small.  The various DPI levels are more than ample for my needs.  The only thing I could complain about is that the macros for the side buttons seem to be sequential, only without provision for concurrent key presses such as, Ctrl-C, or Ctrl-V, as far as I can determine.

The keyboard has several colors, pattern options, and brightness level that let you choose between something flashy or less distracting. Letters, numbers, and symbols are large and easy to see clearly when illuminated. Keys are a good large size and very comfortable to type on for a long time, without being loud enough to bother other people a few feet away. The biggest downside is that the keys are too dark to read with the backlight off, so you will always need the backlight on to use it. There is also a very bright red LED for the Num Lock indicator that you may want cover with a piece of black tape. Overall, though it is a good backlit keyboard for all day typing and better than expected for $40-$50.The included mouse, however, is small and anyone with larger than average hands will have to be clutching it wiht your whole hand tightly wrapped around it. The mouse also doesn't slide easily on a mousepad so you must also hold it tighter and push harder to move, which made my hand and wrist ache almost immediately.

It does make a difference, a significant improvement! I used to think I was just a sloppy typist and blamed myself for constantly having to go back and fix words in my sentences. After an hour of typing on this keyboard - I quickly realized that I am a GREAT typist and that my cheap ""dollar store"" quality keyboards I've used in the past were the issue! I found myself flying through emails, never having to look down at the keyboard, and trusting that every letter and number I type would actually work and type as intended. The keys feel great, they are responsive and sensitive, and they all work perfectly.I had no interests in the color changing abilities of the keyboard- I just wanted something functional and high quality. - BUT I will add that the color changing is incredibly easy. I looked at the direction book for 30 seconds and realized I can choose any color I want, I can have rainbow colors, transitioning colors, breathing/fading or turn the lights off/on - the options are all very easily to cycle through by selecting the FN ( function key) and any combination of the (insert) ( home) (end) (delete) (page up) (page down) keys. Its very easy to remember and allows the user to select any number of colors or combinations of colors.These are my first impressions of the keyboard- but I am very impressed and agree with the rest of the 5 star ratings. This keyboard has all the functionality I am looking for and the color changing ability and options are easy to use/change and remember. 5/5 stars.UPDATE - Months later, and a few hundred hours of typing and this keyboard has not let me down! I love it and have not had any issues with quality or anything malfunctioning or breaking. Keys still feel great, have not gotten slow or sticky at all. 5/5 Stars.",0
J. Hochkins,1.0," March 17, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"I purchase this keyboard for my daughter to play light games on her PC for Christmas. I didn't expect it to be amazing for the price, but I expected it to last more than 3 months without having it flake out. It started not working  when pressing the keys but the lights were on, the mouse worked. The mouse would get stuck as well on the screen and not move on screen. I am not to the point where it works but then after a while, I have to restart her computer and try again. Works sometimes and sometimes the restart didn't work. I don't recommend this set due to it having issues only after a few months and now looking for another one.",1
Xman,1.0," February 5, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"I wanted to like this keyboard, I really did. But I just couldn't after the issues I experienced in a week.I purchased this keyboard for my home to use with my laptop. The first one that came in, the ""enter"" key never worked. And after installing the mouse software, it kept popping up an error that the device must be connected to launch the software. And it did this with every USB port & my USB hub.I contacted Amazon & they sent me another one. The mouse software got re-downloaded & re-installed. Gave the same error. I contacted Redragon, and they sent another software version, which still gave the same error. Fine, I could live with that, though it was a little bit annoying not being able to program the keys.The keyboard didn't remember the RGB settings when I booted up the computer, so I had to change it every time from the scrolling RGB lights. Additionally, it would occasionally type multiple characters when I typed a single character. For example, I would press ""p"" and it would type ""p0"" or ""0p00"" or some other combination. or ""p0-"" or the keys would stick.I wanted to like this (looks nice, mouse feels comfortable, I liked the backlight), but I just couldn't. I've returned both keyboard/mouse combos and will be switching to another brand.",1
Bridgette Moll,1.0," March 23, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"the mouse works but not the keyboard. i got the keyboard and hooked it up and it worked beautifully for about 3 days before the enter key was a bit touche.i tried to fix it in 20 different ways none of them worked, and all the keys around the enter button would hit enter when you hit them. as time when on it just kept getting worse and worse the shift key wouldn't work on the left hand side and if it was pressed it would shut down the rest of the keyboard.the only way i've found to get it to work is to unplug it and completely uninstall all traces of it and then plug it back in and then STILL it breaks in less then 30 minutes on my computer. i don't recommend this keyboard to anyone and i don't recommend this company to anyone they don't even have the drivers online for the keyboard or in the package. even when i had another keyboard hooked up to type, it infected the other keyboard so that after every keystroke it pressed enter and it did it until i unplugged the shitty thing.",1
Mr RTGARCIA,5.0," November 5, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"In a short time using the keyboard and the mouse, I have fallen in love with the features and buttery smoothness of use.  I love the feel of the keys on the keyboard and makes typing a joy.  Smooth and the key travel has a nice feel for an assurance of the feedback click and clacking of the keys.  The mouse is so smooth and nice to move about the pages and tabs.  Also, has the buttons and keys with an assurance of accurate usage. I am not a gamer per se, but I love these types of devices to make my time on my computer enjoyable and very smooth. I have had other types of keyboards and mouses.  Wireless and with direct wire connections but never truly satisfied with the action and usage of the devices.  At times it would feel like a chore in engaging with the devices.  Making my typing assignments a nightmare in attempting to type what is needed in a timely manner.  I love my Redragon keyboard and mouse, for the price, it is a sound investment for the time spent on my computer to type out emails, reports, or my future best-selling novel.  Fantastic product and devices.",0

I thought it would be a good replacement for my very old Blackweb (I loved that Keyboard, and it's still going strong.) I had to replace that one because my new sitting set up, it was to big and bulky for where I was gaming now, also they don't make Blackweb anymore or I would have gotten a smaller Blackweb.My problem is now the Left Shift key doesn't work with the Z key anymore at all (I have to use the cap locks key to get a big Z), it works with all the other letters, and I can't use the Left Shift key with the Enter Key anymore, I have to use the right one which is weird. The other thing is the Right Shift Key won't Capitalize the Z key either.  It's not like I use that letter often, but sometimes I do... and the enter thing is a pain in the butt. I won't be getting this keyboard brand anymore... I am sorry but four months and it's breaking... I am not even that rough or hard on my keyboards.

Maggie,5.0," January 31, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"The whole thing feels very nice to use and isn't as loud as some other gaming keyboards I've heard in the past. While you definitely hear the keys the noise isn't obnoxious and quiet enough that you can't even really hear it with headphones on (which is how I spend most of my time anyway) if you're using your gaming PC as a work computer as well you shouldn't have any issue using this for prolonged periods of time even if you're typing a lot.The mouse is pretty cool as well and the only issues I'm having (just after setting it up) are definitely user errors. I can't get fn+home to set it to a solid color but the home button works and the other commands work perfectly. The instructions are a little vague at first on how to do certain things but enough clicking around on the mouse (which desperately needed it's DPI changed out of the box IMO) got me to where I needed it.Edit: There's three home buttons on this thing, if you want the solid color background you need to hit the home button between the ""insert"" and ""page up"" keys. Just in case anyone out there was like me and very confused by what they were doing wrong for a good five minutes.",0

I got the second one only to find out it did the exact same thing. My pc is new so I know it was not that. I checked Redragon online support. DONT BOTHER. 4 email support tickets and a month later, 2 keyboards and I have returned all of their product. They do NOT answer you about any of their product when you have an issue.

spl42,5.0," December 5, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,So I'll be honest this is my first gaming mouse and keyboard.  I saw it was an Amazon Choice and was $39 for the pair and they had RGB. So I'm thinking well I'll give it a try.  Even though it's only three weeks till Christmas I still got my keyboard with 3-4 days was of course very easy to set up just plug in and it's ready no need to do anything on your computer. I had to read the manual just to figure out how to set color on the keyboard which was very easy.  The keyboard itself is very nice and quiet soft keys very bright.  The mouse as well very bright the cable on the mouse is nice because it's red and black which matches my computer table.  This is not one of those really big mouse I'd say average size the RGB is very nice and bright as well just remember to take of the sticker peel on the bottom otherwise the mouse moves slow.  I would recommend this to anyone who might want a gaming keyboard and mouse but doesn't want to spend over $100 a piece for them.,0
Alyssa,1.0," June 12, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"The keyboard and mouse work ok. But if you want ANY information on the mouse you have to go to the website and download software. None of my antivirus and antimalware will let me go to the site. When I give it permission Chrome forces you to add an extension to the browser without explanation as to why. Why should I have to add an extension to my web browser simply to go to their site and download the software I need to make the lights stop blinking on the mouse? I can't even tell if they are supposed to blink. If they blink due to low batteries, and if so where the hell do the batteries go? There's literally nothing in the ""manual"" that explains anything about the mouse.Take some time Redragon to put information about both products in the manual. I have spent too much time trying to figure out a mouse and the stupid lights blinking on it. Plug-n-play? Please....",1

I recently vastly improved my computer resources, MB, RAM, GPU and CPU (Threadripper), CAT 7 cabling, everything is bigger, better and faster, except my wireless mouse and keyboard. A decrease in accuracy, dependability and speed were slowing me down. I dusted off an old USB wired mouse and keyboard and viola, it was a little better. I like positive feedback from the keyboard. I also like back lit keyboards. I like stability in the mouse and great travel distance in small moves when needed. And, I like to feel the mouse, smooth is nice but texture is better. Quick button, short travel results are appreciated. And $$ need to be conserved. So, I took a chance on a “gaming” keyboard and mouse. No regrets with this Red Dragon S101-3 combo. Now after several hours of work, I could not be happier. Accuracy, speed, stability and tactile feedback are A plus. I very much appreciate the adjustable dpi.  The shortcut buttons are a nice, and welcome addition. The bonus is the bling in the variety of backlit options easily changed. Never thought I would care about that, but it is fun.",1

BD,3.0," June 18, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"This without doubt is a cheap price.  It is a little disappointing that it is simply impossible to get the software to recognize and customize the mouse as advertised on current version of Windows 10.  First of all the site that is referenced on the box redragonusa.com to get the software doesn't even function.  I am fairly confident the other redragon websites that you find on a Google searches are for other countries causing the mouse customization app to not detect the mouse is connected.  Spent hours trying to get it to work to no avail.  I really like the keyboard, the only downside is the leds are a little dim.  The mouse would likely have been satisfactory as well.  However, without the ability to install the software and customize the mouse buttons, it is just junk.  In addition to not being able to program the buttons, the pulsing light function on the mouse is just annoying.  I ended up tossing the mouse.",0

I would randomly get the ""-"" (dash) keystroke corrupting spelling, password entries, ...etc. Some keys like the ""@"" key would not work unless pressed with the right ""Shift"" instead of left. When waking computer up from sleep the keyboard would continually submit phantom keys in the password field until it felt like stopping which was roughly 15 seconds worth of data. Tried the keyboard on multiple computers with the same issues. Overall extremely disappointed that the keyboard didn't even serve the purpose of being a reliable input device. Will not buy again.",1

It's nice that you can change backlit options from the keyboard itself but i would like to have some software as well because there is no option to adjust every key separately. Overall i am very pleased.As for the mouse, i am a little disappointed. Firstly, it is ridiculously heavy, i removed all of the weight pieces and it's still noticeably heavier than my previous mouse. Probably because the mouse isn't small at all, anything larger would be too large. People with large hands will like it though.Secondly, it lacks accuracy for a gaming mouse. Adjusting dpi both with and without software (the software is quite good but unfortunately it should be on all the time like MSI Afterburner) gave me headache, it is always either too fast, too slow or both at the same time!Probably, i had too high expectations from a low budget product because my previous mouse was just perfect which i got a long time ago for like 10$.So, 5 stars for the keyboard + 3.5 stars for the mouse = 4 stars for the combo.",3
Allen K. Steele,5.0," January 19, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"I have had this for several months now. This is not a perfect keyboard. However, for the price it is amazing. The only two cons I can think of are that 1) the plastic it's made of feels slightly cheap, but it has held up to daily use very well. 2)  When you shut down your computer, it forgets the color setting you put it on and defaults to rainbow mode. (putting the computer to sleep does not reset color selection) Changing the color settings are very simple, though, and it only takes me a second to get it back in my preferred mode. As for pros, the colors are bright but not too distracting. The keys have a satisfying action and feel very responsive. It has just the right amount of mechanical keyboard noise for me without being overly clicky-clacky.The mouse that comes with the keyboard is simple but solid. It only lights up in red, it's not RGB. However, I bought this keyboard set because I already had experience using this brand of mouse and wanted another one for my new pc. As a casual gamer, this set perfectly fills my needs and I will most likely buy it again.",0

Keyboard is almost silent when pressing the keys, no more click click click when typing, and that did take a little getting use too but not long. I found that the default settings work well for what I'm doing so I doubt I'll be changing any of those. So for the price it is a good buy and the quality seems to be very good. I would recommend this combo for anyone that wants something better than a standard keyboard and has some flare too it.",5
TB2009,3.0," June 28, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"Bought this package for the keyboard, as I wanted something that could be backlit.  I didn't really care about the mouse, but since it was part of the package, figured ""what the hell""...The mouse would be nice, EXCEPT the driver software that controls all of its functionality does not work unless the mouse is plugged directly into the PC.  If you have a KVM switch, the driver software will refuse to start up.  If you try to get around this by temporarily plugging the mouse into the PC directly and configuring it with the driver software, those settings will be LOST once you disconnect it and plug it back into your KVM switch.This wouldn't be a dealbreaker, EXCEPT the mouse's default lighting mode is a throbbing red light, which is not suitable for some rooms (a bedroom, etc).  There's no way to turn it off unless you plug the mouse directly into the PC, and LEAVE IT permanently plugged into the PC.The keyboard seems fine, but many of the ""special functions"" (mute button, volume controls, etc) don't seem to work either (even after a reboot), which leaves me to wonder whether it needs to be plugged directly into the PC as well in order for ALL the functionality to work.Long story short, if you use a KVM switch, think long and hard about buying this package...  you might end up disappointed when you see all the features you DON'T get to use.",0

Charlie,2.0," December 17, 2019",Reviewed in the United States ,"While I wasn't expecting much from a $30 KBM RGB combo, I was shocked to find what I did when I opened this particular order. The package was shipped in the manufactures box, so when the delivery personnel left said package on my front door step, any one and everyone could see I what I ordered, and could have stolen it at any moment. On top of that, the box was slightly damaged, from shipping understandably. Upon open the box was where the real troubles arise. The Keyboard had smudges on it, as if it had already been used by a semi pro gamer who lived off of mountain dew and cheetos. Easily wiped off, but still concerning. The topper, was the product sticker on the bottom of the mouse. It looked like it had been peeled by an anxiety ridden worker in the process of packaging. That, or was adhered with watered down elmers glue. The last thing I noticed, was the logo on top op the keyboard was upside down. I'm not sure if thats the design of the keyboard, but it definitely looks out of place.As far as functionality goes, the keyboard and the mouse seem to work just fine for now. The mouse being weighted with all the weights, still ended up being lighter than my old, unweighted mouse. The mouse has one led mode. Red. While the keyboard has 6 modes, all accessible via the FN key and the key cluster above the arrow keys, as well as utilizing the arrow keys to adjust pulse length and brightness.",1
B. Hannum,3.0," June 4, 2021",Reviewed in the United States ,"The keyboard is fine, but the mouse is underwhelming, and I'll explain why.First off, when I went to look for the program to configure the mouse, it falls under S601 now, not S101 as it is stated. That caused a bit of confusion.Secondly; the DPI toggle is one button. Most gaming mice have 2 buttons to toggle the DPI up and down on the fly. With a 1 button setup, if I am on Setting 2 (1200 DPI) and want to switch to Setting 1 (600 DPI), I cannot toggle UP. I have to go through Settings 3, 4, & 5, and THEN back to 1.That's pretty bad, given that gaming in fist-person shooters is frequently done with a high DPI to look around, then a low DPI to precisely aim. With my old, $20 mouse, I could toggle up and down. With this mouse, I have to frantically mash the DPI toggle to get back to a lower setting.Secondly: Other programmable mouse I have had frequently have different colors for different DPI settings.This mouse has one tiny strip-light that flashes at different speeds, just below the toggle button...In the center of the mouse...Where your hand will be covering it. If you look in the picture, the DPI toggle button looks like a chevron/ arrow pointing down at the light that flashes.Just two horrible design choices that make the mouse pretty lousy for gaming.But at least the keyboard is nice and quiet and feels nice to use.And the mouse feels nice in my hand. It's just got bad ideas, design-wise.",1

There seems to be slightly more keys as well, though I'm not sure what. I don't really know what people look for in keyboards to give a helpful review, uhhhh....the gaps are big enough to easily allow crumbs and cheeto dust to fall through, or be blown back out I suppose. I really like the lights and adjustable colors, brightness, and fluctuation patterns. Feels super sci fi and I just love that. The cord has a fabric covering with a velcro retainer strap that allows the wire to be shortened pretty easily, so that's kinda gankster. The mouse is okay. The buttons on it feel likd of wobbly and fragile, like it's made of very thin and inflexible plastic potato chips, but the two thumb buttons have a smooth one and a ridged one, allowing touch recognition.

But once you get used to them, you'll want nothing else. the lack of latency is also pretty cool. I have only two complaints:Changing the colored backlit feature is a bit of a PITA. You've got a cool but very distracting cascading rainbow by default, and I have to look at the manual to remember how to switch it (it's not clearly marked on the keyboard). I prefer red or purple (the most pleasant, IMHO).The mouse has a cheap plastiky feel on the sides that gets slick with any perspiration. Again, I'm not a gamer and only a businessman. I can't imaging playing some intense game with this mouse unless I put some pine resin on my thumb and pinky because the sides get *slick* with just the slightest bit of perspiration.Otherwise I'm very happy with both of these keyboard/mice sets.",0

I never programmed the colors on mine but i've seen some pics of people who have done it and it looks pretty good! it may just be mine but the lights weren't that bright but the lights on the mouse are real bright! the keys feel ok with a pretty short travel distance but not as clicky as i've come to like. but by no means is it a bad keyboard!I've already upgraded my mouse to one that's a little more comfy to me. it was just a little too small for my hand and didn't really palm well for me. my fingers were always hanging over the end of the mouse. this is probably a better mouse for younger people with smaller hands. the scroll wheel on it is also not that great. the notches when scrolling either on web pages or in games to switch weapons, etc... are really not well defined and when playing shooters i always over scroll the wheel when trying to switch weapons and its got me killed several times. still not a bad mouse though! these are all things i don't see new pc gamers noticing until upgrading.  My pc actually ended up coming with a keyboard (but no mouse...) and i've switched to the one it came with because its much brighter, clicky, and mechanical which i recommend upgrading to when this keyboard craps out or you simply want to upgrade.overall though this is a solid option for new pc gamers or someone who doesn't want to spend $100 or more on a mouse and keyboard. its not something i would see anyone using long term but not a bad cheap option if you're on a budget.",0

Kindle Customer,3.0," September 2, 2020",Reviewed in the United States ,"This keyboard/mouse was fine with me for everything except word processing. The flaw is that, when you use the key combination SHIFT-ENTER the keyboard is supposed to send out a carriage return code followed by line-feed code (usually abbreviated when talking about it as CRLF).This keyboard sends out nothing when those two keys are used together.Microsoft Word, the Google gMail app, Google Documents, use this combination of keys to modify what happens in their apps. For example, if you set a bullet point in one of these apps, when you do hit Enter, a new line that starts with a bullet dot is created. If you want a new line without a bullet, then you use the SHIFT-ENTER combination. This works for bullet lists, numbered bullet lists and paragraph endings.I'm sure most of you who have done some word processing, not just text editing, but dicuments that have formatting, you will know about this.So an otherwise nice keyboard is going back to Amazon tomorrow.",0
